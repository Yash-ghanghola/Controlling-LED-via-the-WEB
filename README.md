# 🌐 PWM LED Control via Web using ESP8266 💡

Control your LED brightness directly from a web browser! This IoT project uses the *ESP8266 (NodeMCU)* to create a web server that allows real-time *PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)* control of an LED using a slider.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases the power of *IoT and embedded systems, making remote control seamless and interactive. Imagine the possibilities—from **smart home lighting* to *industrial automation*!

With just a simple slider on a web page, you can *adjust the LED brightness in real-time*.

---

## ✅ Built With

- *ESP8266 (NodeMCU)* for WiFi-based control  
- *Web-based PWM interface* (HTML + JavaScript)  
- *Real-time LED brightness adjustment* via PWM  
- *Arduino IDE* for coding and flashing firmware  

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. ESP8266 sets up a local web server  
2. User accesses the web page on the same network  
3. Slider on the page sends PWM values  
4. LED brightness changes in real-time according to input
